                         Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep it to 1 page
                         if you have less than 8 years of professional work experience. If
                         you have more, you might consider using 2 pages.

                     <li>
                         Include a skills section - it's incredibly important. This step
                         will prove highly valuable if the company uses ATS (applicant
                         tracking system).

                         submit your resume in pdf format. You can convert this file to pdf
                         in google docs by going to File, select Download, and then pdf.

                         Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending on the
                         duration and relevance of the position. Keep sections that are
                         less relevant to the job you're applying to short.

                         you need to quantify the impact of your work. Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, 
                         so quantify as much as you can. You can talk about xx% improvement your initiatives yielded.
                     </li>

                         Or you could mention the increase in company revenue of xx% that your work contributed to.

                     <li>
                         Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. 
                         No recruiter will read bullet points that are as long as paragraphs.

                         Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate any typos.
                         Additionally, consider having someone else proofread it to prevent sending an imperfect resume.
